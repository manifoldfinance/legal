How this Application works

Brokering
This Application helps Users to find Products offered by Sellers that
best meet their needs. To this end, this Application selects best
matching Sellers and introduces them to Users.
The Owner benefits from its brokering activity only if such activity
results in a concluded contract or transaction between the Users and the
Sellers. Only in such cases will the Owner charge a fee according to the
criteria specified on this Application.

The Owner does not control, monitor, moderate or inspect any Products
offered by Sellers via this Application. This means that the Owner does
not bear any responsibility in connection with such Products, including
but not limited to their quality, safety, accuracy, or the Sellers’
ability to provide them.

Likewise, the Owner does not control, monitor, moderate or inspect
Buyers using this Application. Therefore, the Owner does not bear any
responsibility in connection with such Buyers’ activity on this
Application, including but not limited to their legal capacity or
ability to complete a transaction and pay the associated costs.

By accepting the Terms, Users fully and unconditionally release and
forever discharge the Owner, its officers, directors, employees and
agents from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual or
consequential, direct or indirect), whether now known or unknown, of
every kind and nature relating to, arising out of or in any way
connected with:

disputes between Users, or any other person or entity,
the Products’ use, including, without limitation, any and all claims
that such use violates any of Seller’s intellectual property rights,
copyrights, rights of publicity or privacy, “moral rights,” or
rights of attribution and integrity, or
Users’ activity on this Application, including, but not limited to,
Users’ legal capacity, ability to complete a transaction, or pay the
associated costs. User acknowledges and agrees that the Owner has no
control over, and shall have no liability for any damages resulting
from, the use or misuse by any other person or entity of any Products.
If the Owner becomes aware of any Products that allegedly may not
conform to the Terms, the Owner may investigate the allegation and
determine in its sole discretion whether to take action in accordance
with the Terms. The Owner has no liability or responsibility to Users
for performance or nonperformance of such activities. The Owner has the
absolute right to remove and/or delete without notice any Products
within its control that it deems objectionable. Users consent to such
removal and/or deletion and waive any claim against the Owner for such
removal and/or deletion. The Owner is not responsible or liable for
failure to store posted content or other materials Users may transmit
through this Application. Users shall take measures to preserve copies
of any data, material, content or information such User posts on this
Application. Any identity verification methods the Owner employs is
strictly on a best efforts basis and shall not be relied upon by Users.
The Service of this Application is provided at no monetary cost to
Buyers. Products offered by the Owner or by Sellers via this Application
are marked as such.

This Application merely serves as a technical infrastructure or platform
to allow Users to interact with each other. The Owner therefore is not
directly involved in any such interactions between Users.

These Terms only apply to the described usage of this Application as a
platform.
Terms, conditions and any other provision applying specifically to
transactions between Buyers and Sellers are specified by each Seller.

Paid Products
Some of the Products provided on this Application, as part of the
Service, are provided on the basis of payment.

The fees, duration and conditions applicable to the purchase of such
Products are described below and in the dedicated sections of this
Application.

Product description
Prices, descriptions or availability of Products are outlined in the
respective sections of this Application and are subject to change
without notice.

While Products on this Application are presented with the greatest
accuracy technically possible, representation on this Application
through any means (including, as the case may be, graphic material,
images, colors, sounds) is for reference only and implies no warranty as
to the characteristics of the purchased Product.

The characteristics of the chosen Product will be outlined during the
purchasing process.

Purchasing process
Any steps taken from choosing a Product to order submission form part of
the purchasing process.

The purchasing process includes these steps:

Users must choose the desired Product and verify their purchase
selection.
After having reviewed the information displayed in the purchase
selection, Users may place the order by submitting it.
Order submission
When the User submits an order, the following applies:

The submission of an order determines contract conclusion and therefore
creates for the User the obligation to pay the price, taxes and possible
further fees and expenses, as specified on the order page.
In case the purchased Product requires active input from the User, such
as the provision of personal information or data, specifications or
special wishes, the order submission creates an obligation for the User
to cooperate accordingly.
Upon submission of the order, Users will receive a receipt confirming
that the order has been received.
All notifications related to the described purchasing process shall be
sent to the email address provided by the User for such purposes.

Prices
Users are informed during the purchasing process and before order
submission, about any fees, taxes and costs (including, if any, delivery
costs) that they will be charged.

Prices on this Application are displayed:

either exclusive or inclusive of any applicable fees, taxes and costs,
depending on the section the User is browsing.
Offers and discounts
The Owner may offer discounts or provide special offers for the purchase
of Products. Any such offer or discount shall always be subject to the
eligibility criteria and the terms and conditions set out in the
corresponding section of this Application.

Offers and discounts are always granted at the Owner’s sole
discretion.

Repeated or recurring offers or discounts create no claim/title or right
that Users may enforce in the future.

Depending on the case, discounts or offers shall be valid for a limited
time only or while stocks last. If an offer or discount is limited by
time, the time indications refer to the time zone of the Owner, as
indicated in the Owner’s location details in this document, unless
otherwise specified.

Coupons
Offers or discounts can be based on Coupons.

If breach of the conditions applicable to Coupons occurs, the Owner can
legitimately refuse to fulfill its contractual obligations and expressly
reserves the right to take appropriate legal action to protect its
rights and interests.

Notwithstanding the provisions below, any additional or diverging rules
applicable to using the Coupon displayed in the corresponding
information page or on the Coupon itself shall always prevail.

Unless otherwise stated, these rules apply to the use of Coupons:

Each Coupon is only valid when used in the manner and within the
timeframe specified on the website and/or the Coupon;
A Coupon may only be applied, in its entirety, at the actual time of
purchase – partial use is not permitted;
Unless otherwise stated, single-use Coupons may only be used once per
purchase and therefore may only be applied a single time even in cases
involving installment-based purchases;
A Coupon cannot be applied cumulatively;
The Coupon must be redeemed exclusively within the time specified in the
offer. After this period, the Coupon will automatically expire,
precluding any possibility for the User to claim the relevant rights,
including cash-out;
The User is not entitled to any credit/refund/compensation if there is a
difference between the value of the Coupon and the redeemed value;
The Coupon is intended solely for non–commercial use. Any
reproduction, counterfeiting and commercial trade of the Coupon is
strictly forbidden, along with any illegal activity related to the
purchase and/or use of the Coupon.
Methods of payment
Information related to accepted payment methods are made available
during the purchasing process.

Some payment methods may only be available subject to additional
conditions or fees. In such cases related information can be found in
the dedicated section of this Application.

Payment methods marked accordingly are managed directly by the Owner. In
this case, the Owner collects and stores the data necessary for the
processing of payments and for fulfilling any legal obligation related
to them. The User may read the privacy policy of this Application to
learn more about the data processing and Users’ rights regarding their
data.

Other payment methods – if any – are independently provided by
third-party services. In such cases this Application collects no payment
information – such as credit card details – but only receives a
notification from the relevant third-party provider once the payment has
been successfully completed.

If payment through the available methods fail, the Owner shall be under
no obligation to fulfil the purchase order. Any possible costs or fees
resulting from the failed or refused payment shall be borne by the
User.

Virtual Currency for exclusive use inside this Application
On this Application certain payments may be made using a Virtual
Currency. Unless otherwise stated, such Virtual Currency is not
tradable, exchangeable or redeemable against any traditional currency,
any other open digital currency, goods or any other values.

By purchasing Virtual Currency, Users acknowledge and understand that it
may only be used within this Application for the purposes expressly
authorized by the Owner within the framework of its Services. Users also
acknowledge and agree that they may not transfer, purchase, sell, or
exchange such Virtual Currency outside of the Service.

Accordingly, Users may not sublicense, trade, sell or attempt to sell
Virtual Currency for money, or exchange Virtual Currency for value of
any kind outside of the dedicated offering provided by the Owner through
this Application. Any such prohibited use or transaction shall be
considered null and void and could result in legal action being taken
against the User.

In case of contract or account termination for any cause attributable to
the User, any and all unused Virtual Currency shall be forfeited and no
refund shall be granted.

Retention of usage rights
Users do not acquire any rights to use the purchased Product until the
total purchase price is received by the Owner.

Contractual right of cancellation
The Owner grants Users a contractual right to cancel the purchase under
the terms and conditions described in the relevant section of this
Application within 15 days of concluding the contract.

Delivery
Performance of services
The purchased service shall be performed or made available within the
timeframe specified on this Application or as communicated before the
order submission.

Users acknowledge and accept that the purchase of services available on
this Application may be subject to further conditions under applicable
law, the Terms or any other related document.
Users may be required to provide evidence or declare that such
conditions – e.g. being considered an adult under applicable law –
are met.
In such situations, failure to meet the conditions set forth by law or
contract may make it impossible to perform or deliver the services.

User rights
Right of withdrawal
Unless exceptions apply, the User may be eligible to withdraw from the
contract within the period specified below (generally 14 days), for any
reason and without justification. Users can learn more about the
withdrawal conditions within this section.

Who the right of withdrawal applies to
Unless any applicable exception is mentioned below, Users who are
European Consumers are granted a statutory cancellation right under EU
rules, to withdraw from contracts entered into online (distance
contracts) within the specified period applicable to their case, for any
reason and without justification.

Users that do not fit this qualification, cannot benefit from the rights
described in this section.

Exercising the right of withdrawal
To exercise their right of withdrawal, Users must send to the Owner an
unequivocal statement of their intention to withdraw from the contract.

To this end, Users may use the model withdrawal form available from
within the “definitions” section of this document. Users are,
however, free to express their intention to withdraw from the contract
by making an unequivocal statement in any other suitable way. In order
to meet the deadline within which they can exercise such right, Users
must send the withdrawal notice before the withdrawal period expires.

When does the withdrawal period expire?

Regarding the purchase of a service, the withdrawal period expires 14
days after the day that the contract is entered into, unless the User
has waived the withdrawal right.
Effects of withdrawal
Users who correctly withdraw from a contract will be reimbursed by the
Owner for all payments made to the Owner, including, if any, those
covering the costs of delivery.

However, any additional costs resulting from the choice of a particular
delivery method other than the least expensive type of standard delivery
offered by the Owner, will not be reimbursed.

Such reimbursement shall be made without undue delay and, in any event,
no later than 14 days from the day on which the Owner is informed of the
User’s decision to withdraw from the contract. Unless otherwise agreed
with the User, reimbursements will be made using the same means of
payment as used to process the initial transaction. In any event, the
User shall not incur any costs or fees as a result of such
reimbursement.

…on the purchase of services
Where a User exercises the right of withdrawal after having requested
that the service be performed before the withdrawal period expires, the
User shall pay to the Owner an amount which is in proportion to the part
of service provided.

Such payment shall be calculated based on the economic value of the
service and be proportional to the part of service provided until the
time the User withdraws compared to the full coverage of the contract.

Contractual withdrawal period extension
In addition, and without prejudice to the statutory right of withdrawal
or any other statutory rights, including guarantee rights, the Owner
grants Users a contractual right to withdraw from the contract within 30
days. Users can therefore withdraw from the contract even once the
statutory withdrawal period has expired.

The contractual extension of the withdrawal period is subject to the
same conditions stated for the statutory right of withdrawal, including
those for determining the beginning and the end of the withdrawal
period.

damages resulting from the breach of an essential contractual obligation
such as any obligation strictly necessary to achieve the purpose of the
contract, and/or damages resulting from intent or gross negligence, as
long as this Application has been appropriately and correctly used by
the User.

Unless damages have been caused by way of intent or gross negligence, or
they affect life, health or physical integrity, the Owner shall only be

data that results from such download or Users’ use of the Service.

The Owner does not warrant, endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility
for any product or service advertised or offered by a third party
through the Service or any hyperlinked website or service, and the Owner
shall not be a party to or in any way monitor any transaction between
Users and third-party providers of products or services.

The Service may become inaccessible or it may not function properly with
Users’ web browser, mobile device, and/or operating system. The owner
cannot be held liable for any perceived or actual damages arising from
Service content, operation, or use of this Service.

Federal law, some states, and other jurisdictions, do not allow the
exclusion and limitations of certain implied warranties. The above
exclusions may not apply to Users. This Agreement gives Users specific
legal rights, and Users may also have other rights which vary from state
to state. The disclaimers and exclusions under this agreement shall not
apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.

Limitations of liability
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the
Owner, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents,
co-branders, partners, suppliers and employees be liable for

any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary
damages, including without limitation damages for loss of profits,
goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses, arising out of or
relating to the use of, or inability to use, the Service; and
any damage, loss or injury resulting from hacking, tampering or other
unauthorized access or use of the Service or User account or the
information contained therein;
any errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content;
personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting
from User access to or use of the Service;
any unauthorized access to or use of the Owner’s secure servers and/or
any and all personal information stored therein;
any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the Service;
any bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like that may be transmitted to
or through the Service;
any errors or omissions in any content or for any loss or damage
incurred as a result of the use of any content posted, emailed,

obligations, damages, losses or costs in an amount exceeding the amount
paid by User to the Owner hereunder in the preceding 12 months, or the
period of duration of this agreement between the Owner and User,
whichever is shorter.
This limitation of liability section shall apply to the fullest extent
permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction whether the alleged
liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or
any other basis, even if company has been advised of the possibility of
such damage.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
incidental or consequential damages, therefore the above limitations or
exclusions may not apply to User. The terms give User specific legal
rights, and User may also have other rights which vary from jurisdiction
to jurisdiction. The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of
liability under the terms shall not apply to the extent prohibited by
applicable law.

statutory provision by User or its affiliates, officers, directors,
agents, co-branders, partners, suppliers and employees to the extent
allowed by applicable law.

of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining
provisions, which shall remain in full force and effect.

US Users
Any such invalid or unenforceable provision will be interpreted,
construed and reformed to the extent reasonably required to render it
valid, enforceable and consistent with its original intent. These Terms

substituting the void, invalid or unenforceable parts.
In case of failure to do so, the void, invalid or unenforceable
provisions shall be replaced by the applicable statutory provisions, if
so permitted or stated under the applicable law.

Without prejudice to the above, the nullity, invalidity or the
impossibility to enforce a particular provision of these Terms shall not
nullify the entire Agreement, unless the severed provisions are
essential to the Agreement, or of such importance that the parties would
not have entered into the contract if they had known that the provision
would not be valid, or in cases where the remaining provisions would
translate into an unacceptable hardship on any of the parties.
