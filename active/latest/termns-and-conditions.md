Some of the Products provided on meveth.xyz, as part of the Service, are
provided on the basis of payment.

The fees, duration and conditions applicable to the purchase of such
Products are described below and in the dedicated sections of
meveth.xyz.

### Product description

Prices, descriptions or availability of Products are outlined in the
respective sections of meveth.xyz and are subject to change without
notice.

While Products on meveth.xyz are presented with the greatest accuracy
technically possible, representation on meveth.xyz through any means
(including, as the case may be, graphic material, images, colours,
sounds) is for reference only and implies no warranty as to the
characteristics of the purchased Product.

The characteristics of the chosen Product will be outlined during the
purchasing process.

### Purchasing process

Any steps taken from choosing a Product to order submission form part of
the purchasing process.

The purchasing process includes these steps:

-   Users must choose the desired Product and verify their purchase
    selection.
-   After having reviewed the information displayed in the purchase
    selection, Users may place the order by submitting it.

### Order submission

When the User submits an order, the following applies:

-   The submission of an order determines contract conclusion and
    therefore creates for the User the obligation to pay the price,
    taxes and possible further fees and expenses, as specified on the
    order page.
-   In case the purchased Product requires an action from the User, such
    as the provision of personal information or data, specifications or
    special wishes, the order submission creates an obligation for the
    User to cooperate accordingly.
-   Upon submission of the order, Users will receive a receipt
    confirming that the order has been received.

All notifications related to the described purchasing process shall be
sent to the email address provided by the User for such purposes.

-   excluding any applicable fees, taxes and costs.

### Methods of payment

Information related to accepted payment methods are made available
during the purchasing process.

Some payment methods may only be available subject to additional
conditions or fees. In such cases related information can be found in
the dedicated section of meveth.xyz.

All payments are independently processed through third-party services.
Therefore, meveth.xyz does not collect any payment information – such as
credit card details – but only receives a notification once the payment
has been successfully completed.

If a payment through the available methods fails or is refused by the
payment service provider, the Owner shall be under no obligation to
fulfil the purchase order. If a payment fails or is refused, the Owner
reserves the right to claim any related expenses or damages from the
User.

### Virtual Currency for exclusive use inside meveth.xyz

On meveth.xyz certain payments may be made using a Virtual Currency.

open digital currency, goods or any other values.

may only be used within meveth.xyz for the purposes expressly authorised
by the Owner within the framework of its Services. Users also
acknowledge and agree that they may not transfer, purchase, sell, or
exchange such Virtual Currency outside of the Service.

Accordingly, Users may not sublicense, trade, sell or attempt to sell
Virtual Currency for money, or exchange Virtual Currency for value of
any kind outside of the dedicated offering provided by the Owner through
meveth.xyz. Any such prohibited use or transaction shall be considered
null and void and could result in legal action being taken against the
User.

In case of contract or account termination for any cause attributable to
the User, any and all unused Virtual Currency shall be forfeited and no
refund shall be granted.

### Retention of usage rights

Users do not acquire any rights to use the purchased Product until the
total purchase price is received by the Owner.

In such situations, failure to meet the conditions set forth by law or
contract may make it impossible to perform or deliver the services.

## User rights

### Right of withdrawal

Unless exceptions apply, the User may be eligible to withdraw from the
contract within the period specified below (generally 14 days), for any
reason and without justification. Users can learn more about the
withdrawal conditions within this section.

#### The right of withdrawal does not apply on meveth.xyz

Users acknowledge and accept that the right of withdrawal does not apply
to contracts concluded over meveth.xyz due to the nature of its

### UK User rights

#### Right to cancel

Unless exceptions apply, Users who are Consumers in the United Kingdom
have a legal right of cancellation under UK law and may be eligible to
withdraw from contracts made online (distance contracts) within the
period specified below (generally 14 days), for any reason and without
justification.

Users that do not qualify as Consumers, cannot benefit from the rights
described in this section. Users can learn more about the cancellation
conditions within this section.

##### Exercising the right to cancel

To exercise their right to cancel, Users must send to the Owner an
unequivocal statement of their intention to withdraw from the contract.
To this end, Users may use the model withdrawal form available from
within the “definitions” section of this document. Users are, however,
free to express their intention to withdraw from the contract by making
an unequivocal statement in any other suitable way. In order to meet the
deadline within which they can exercise such right, Users must send the
withdrawal notice before the cancellation period expires. When does the
cancellation period expire?

-   **Regarding the purchase of goods,** the cancellation period expires
    14 days after the day on which the User or a third party – other
    than the carrier and designated by the User – takes physical
    possession of the goods.
-   **Regarding the purchase of several goods ordered together** but
    delivered separately or in case of purchase of a single good
    consisting of multiple lots or pieces delivered separately, the
    cancellation period expires 14 days after the day on which the User
    or a third party – other than the carrier and designated by the User
    – acquires physical possession of the last good, lot or piece.

##### Effects of cancellation

Users who correctly withdraw from a contract will be reimbursed by the
Owner for all payments made to the Owner, including, if any, those
covering the costs of delivery.

However, any additional costs resulting from the choice of a particular
delivery method other than the least expensive type of standard delivery
offered by the Owner, will not be reimbursed.

Such reimbursement shall be made without undue delay and, in any event,
no later than 14 days from the day on which the Owner is informed of the
User’s decision to withdraw from the contract. Unless otherwise agreed
with the User, reimbursements will be made using the same means of
payment as used to process the initial transaction. In any event, the
User shall not incur any costs or fees as a result of such
reimbursement.

###### …on the purchase of physical goods

Unless the Owner has offered to collect the goods, Users shall send back
the goods or hand them over to the Owner, or to a person authorized by
the latter to receive the goods, without undue delay and in any event
within 14 days from the day on which they communicated their decision to
withdraw from the contract.

The deadline is met if the goods are handed to the carrier, or otherwise
returned as indicated above, before the expiration of the 14-days-period
for returning the goods. The reimbursement may be withheld until
reception of the goods, or until Users have supplied evidence of having
returned the goods, whichever is the earliest.

Users shall only be liable for any diminished value of the goods
resulting from the handling of the goods outside of that which is
necessary to establish their nature, characteristics and functioning.

**The costs of returning the goods are borne by the User.**

### Brazilian User rights

#### Right of Regret

Unless an applicable exception is stated below, Users who are Consumers
in Brazil have a legal right of regret under Brazilian law. This means
that the Consumer has the right to withdraw from contracts made online
(distance contracts or any contract signed away from business premises)
within seven (7) days of the date the contract was entered into or the
receipt of the product or service, for any reason and without
justification. Users that do not qualify as Consumers, cannot benefit
from the rights described in this section. The right of regret may be
exercised by the Consumer via contact channels listed at the beginning
of this Document and in accordance with the guidelines in this Section.

The right of regret does not apply to contracts that have been entered
into with the Owner. It may, however, apply to contracts entered into
with Sellers. If applicable, the right to withdraw from contracts
entered into with Sellers via meveth.xyz is subject to the conditions
and specifications made available by each Seller on meveth.xyz.

liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or
any other basis, even if company has been advised of the possibility of

## Common provisions

### No Waiver

The Owner’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms
shall not constitute a waiver of any such right or provision. No waiver
shall be considered a further or continuing waiver of such term or any
other term.

### Service interruption

To ensure the best possible service level, the Owner reserves the right
to interrupt the Service for maintenance, system updates or any other
changes, informing the Users appropriately.

Within the limits of law, the Owner may also decide to suspend or
discontinue the Service altogether. If the Service is discontinued, the
Owner will cooperate with Users to enable them to withdraw Personal Data
or information and will respect Users' rights relating to continued
product use and/or compensation, as provided for by applicable law.

Additionally, the Service might not be available due to reasons outside
the Owner’s reasonable control, such as “force majeure” events(
infrastructural breakdowns or blackouts etc.).

portion of meveth.xyz and of its Service without the Owner’s express
prior written permission, granted either directly or through a
legitimate reselling program.

Without prejudice to any more specific provision of these Terms, any
intellectual property rights, such as copyrights, trademark rights,

any time. In such cases, the Owner will appropriately inform the User of
these changes.

Such changes will only affect the relationship with the User from the
date communicated to Users onwards.

The continued use of the Service will signify the User’s acceptance of
the revised Terms. If Users do not wish to be bound by the changes, they
must stop using the Service and may terminate the Agreement.

The applicable previous version will govern the relationship prior to
the User's acceptance. The User can obtain any previous version from the
Owner.

novation, or subcontract any or all rights or obligations under these

the contact information stated in this document.

Should any provision of these Terms be deemed or become invalid or
unenforceable under applicable law, the invalidity or unenforceability
of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining
provisions, which shall remain in full force and effect.

#### US Users

Any such invalid or unenforceable provision will be interpreted,
construed and reformed to the extent reasonably required to render it
valid, enforceable and consistent with its original intent. These Terms
constitute the entire Agreement between Users and the Owner with respect

including but not limited to all prior agreements, between the parties
with respect to such subject matter. These Terms will be enforced to the
fullest extent permitted by law.

#### EU Users

Should any provision of these Terms be or be deemed void, invalid or
unenforceable, the parties shall do their best to find, in an amicable
way, an agreement on valid and enforceable provisions thereby
substituting the void, invalid or unenforceable parts.  
In case of failure to do so, the void, invalid or unenforceable
provisions shall be replaced by the applicable statutory provisions, if
so permitted or stated under the applicable law.

Without prejudice to the above, the nullity, invalidity or the
impossibility to enforce a particular provision of these Terms shall not
nullify the entire Agreement, unless the severed provisions are
essential to the Agreement, or of such importance that the parties would
not have entered into the contract if they had known that the provision
would not be valid, or in cases where the remaining provisions would
translate into an unacceptable hardship on any of the parties.

These Terms are drawn up and revised in English. Other language versions
of these Terms are provided for information purposes only. In the event
of any inconsistency between different linguistic versions, the original
version shall always prevail.
